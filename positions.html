<h2><a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> Team Lead</h2>
Just a solid programmer who writes great code, can ship, and can encourage others to write great code. Python/C++. Know about release engineering, testing, documentation, and good coding practices.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>UI/UX Designer</h2>
Tell our story with pretty pictures. Design products people already know how to use. Communicate the car's intention. Know about funnels, Photoshop, HTML/CSS, light JS, and what a good experience <em>feels</em> like.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Controls/Planning</h2>
We are starting to accumulate a massive amount of data about how cars drive. Currently our driving system <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> is 100% reactive. Add in GPS information, categorize, and drive down the worldwide number of disengagements that appear on MassiveMap (our internal worldwide map of all users). Know about PID loops, how to debug, how sensors work, and when sensors fail.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Simulation/Testing</h2>
Take a comma <a href="https://github.com/commaai/neo">neo</a> running <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a>, point it at a computer running GTA or similar, and have it drive. Write and maintain openpilot <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/selfdrive/test/plant">regression tests</a>. Maintain and improve our internal route replay infrastructure. Drive and regression test real cars. Know how to test well, Python, C++, and React.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
Improve our internal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561">segnets</a> and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5539-depth-map-prediction-from-a-single-image-using-a-multi-scale-deep-network.pdf">depthnets</a>. Work on our automatic ground truthing and ML pipeline. Build better models for openpilot and ship them. Know about <a href="http://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, softmax, ground truthing, and Keras.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<br/>
All positions are full time and on site in our beautiful new <b>San Francisco, CA</b> office. Jobs do not have requirements beyond the generic ones on <a href="hiring.html">hiring</a> and writing <b>good code</b>. Just convince me that <b>you can do the task and make it ship</b>. Our stack is largely written in <b>Python</b>, with some C/C++.
