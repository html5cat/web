<center><h2>Port to new car, upstream the code, get paid</h2></center>
Code must be merged upstream into <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/devel">openpilot devel</a>. System must have both longitudinal and lateral control working, with similar quality to the Honda Civic. If the car doesn't ship with a radar, adding an external one is okay. External actuators don't qualify, port must use built in ones. Extra interface hardware is fine if required (like for Accord). Port must follow <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/SAFETY.md">safety rules</a> to be upstreamed and eligible.

<h3>Chevy Volt -- $10,000</h3>
High end trim includes a radar and adaptive cruise control. Tap into the existing LKAS system and upgrade it!
<h3>Ford Fusion -- $10,000</h3>
If you've used the stock system, you know this car really needs the upgrade. Must be a production car, dataspeed kit car not eligible.
<h3>Toyota Prius or RAV4 -- $10,000</h3>
So many ways in! See <a href="http://illmatics.com/car_hacking.pdf">Adventures in Automotive Networks and Control Units</a> for a place to start.
<h3>Tesla Model S (No AP, AP1, or AP2) -- $5,000</h3>
Steering controller can be commanded over CAN on all Model S. Old Model S don't have a radar, adding one is fine.
<h3>Honda Accord or Acura MDX -- $2,000</h3>
Has the same connector as the Civic. Brake is the same. Steering is done over a 9600 baud LIN connection, marked as EPSTOLKAS and LKASTOEPS.
<h3>Honda CR-V -- $1,000</h3>
Easiest one on the list. The 2016 Touring has the same connector as the ILX and Civic. The brake packet is the same, the steering packet is very similar. Well within the realm of a weekend project.

The above bounties are sponsored by comma.ai, if you'd like to sponsor a bounty or contribute to one, let me know. If you port to a car not on this list in a way that can be upstreamed nicely, we will consider paying out a custom bounty.
